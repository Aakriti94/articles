## What is backward compatibility in Linux?

Backward compatibility means that NEWER version should be able to handle objects produced in OLDER version. A new standard product or model is considered backward compatible when it is able to read, write or view older formats.
For backwards compatibility to be successful, designers need to create the previous versions to be â€œforward compatible." <br>

1. Hardware: Eg: PS 5
2. Software: Eg: Microsoft Word 10 opening up a Microsoft Word 2007 file as well. Mobile apps, where if the OS is updated to a newer version, the aps in the phone could still be used

- Eliminates the need to start over
- Preserves older software and hardware:
- Promotes sales dynamic - eg: gaming
- Supports complementary product creation
- Streamlines releases
