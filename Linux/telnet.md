# Telnet Client

## What is Telnet?

Telnet is Teletype Network Protocol (Remote access Protocol). It is a command line interface for communication with a remote device or server.

## What is telnet server and telnet client

 - Telnetâ€™s overall function is to define a means by which a user or process on one machine can access and use another machine as if it were locally connected.
 - This makes Telnet inherently client/server in operation, like so many other application protocols in TCP/IP.
 - Usually, the **Telnet client** is a piece of software that acts as an interface to the user, processing keystrokes and user commands and presenting output from the remote machine. eg: command prompt.
 - The **Telnet server** is a program running on a remote computer that has been set up to allow remote sessions.

 > We would be focusing on installation of telnet client in this article.

## Why do we need telnet?
 - To access remote machine over the internet.

## Syntax
 > telnet hostname port <br>
   telnet www.host.com 8090

## Usage
The user executes commands on the server by using specific Telnet commands into the Telnet prompt. To end a session and log off, the user ends a Telnet command with Telnet.

- Port used by TCP - port 23
- Port used by SSH - port 22

## What are common uses for Telnet?
